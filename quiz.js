// Code/Tools Requirements

// 1. Use ES6 language features wherever you can. At a minimum, you should be using let, const, fat arrows, property shorthand, method properties, and string templates.
// 2. Have a Gulp task running at all times to validate your JavaScript. We will be validating your project and we should see 0 errors.
// 3. You must have a test suite that validates the core logic of the application.
// 4. You must use jQuery for interacting with the DOM.

// Base Logical Requirements

// You'll be building robots to battle each other.

// 1. A base Robot function.
// 2. Define three robot type functions (e.g. Drone, Bipedal, ATV).
// 3. Define at least 2 specific robot model functions for each type.
// 4. Give each robot model a different range of health. For example, one model can have health range of 50-80, and another one will have a range of 60-120. To accomplish this, read about the Math.random() function in JavaScript.
// 5. Give each robot model a different range of damage they do using the same technique.

// Base Functional Requirements

// 1. When your user interface first loads, provide 2 text inputs to name the two robots that will do battle.
// 2. You must also provide a select element underneath each text input so that the user can select one of the 6 robot models you defined.
// 3. Provide a Attack! button that, when clicked, simply applies the damage output of each robot against the other one.
// 4. Once either robot's health is <0 display a message that the battle is over, and which one won. For example...
// 5. The Viper Drone defeated the Behemoth ATV with its flamethrower.
